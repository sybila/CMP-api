API for managing Rules
Properties marked as read-only are not available when saving (PUT, POST methods).
When retrieving all rules, only "id", "name", "equation" and "status" properties are available.

<json>
{
	"id": Numeric ID, unique among all rules
	"name": Name of rule
	"description": Description of rule
	"equation": Rule's equation in BCSL
	"modifiers": String - mostly list of modifiers, separated by comma, but can be any string basically (will be defined better later!)
	"classifications": List of classification IDs (see Classifications endpoint)
    "organisms": List of organism IDs (see Organisms endpoint)
	"status": Status of rule, one of ["pending", "active", "inactive"]
}
</json>
