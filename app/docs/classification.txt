API for managing Classifications

These should not change much, so they can safely be cached for some time if desirable.

<json>
{
	"id": Numeric ID, unique among all classifications
	"name": Name of classification
	"type": What can this classification be used for, one of ["entity", "rule"]
}
</json>
