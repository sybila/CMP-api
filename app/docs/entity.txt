API for managing Entities
Entities can be searched by the following query parameters:
- name: search entity which has this string in its name
- code: search entity with this code (at most 1 returned)
- annotation: "TYPE:ID", where type is one of doi, kegg, url, chebi, pubchem, uniprot, ec-code, go, eg-code, bnid
Properties marked as read-only are not available when saving (PUT, POST methods).
When retrieving all entities, only "id", "code", "type", "name" and "status" properties are available.

<json>
{
	"id": Numeric ID, unique among all entities
	"code": Code of entity, unique among all entities
	"type": Type of entity, one of ["compartment", "complex", "structure", "atomic"]
	"name": Name of entity
	"description": Description of entity
	"classifications": List of classification IDs (see Classifications endpoint)
	"organisms": List of organism IDs (see Organisms endpoint)
	"status": Status of entity, one of ["pending", "active", "inactive"]
